## Security Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks by limiting requests per IP.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection and XSS attacks.
- **JWT with Refresh Tokens**: Secure authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens. Use `/api/user/refresh-token` to obtain a new access token.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: In production, the server supports HTTPS. Provide paths to your SSL key and certificate via environment variables:

```
SSL_KEY=/path/to/ssl.key
SSL_CERT=/path/to/ssl.cert
```

Set `NODE_ENV=production` to enable HTTPS.
